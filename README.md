# Designer's Newtab
A chrome Newtab extension written mainly for me. It has links to some design websites, /r/wholesomememes, a clock, and a practice design project, e.g. "design a logo for this company."

it only loads from the websites once a day to reduce overhead. otherwise everything is stored in `localStorage`.
